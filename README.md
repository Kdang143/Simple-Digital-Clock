**About This Project**

A simple and precise digital clock for beginners to build with no resistors, potentiometer, or RTC required. It is not a complete alarm clock but you can set a certain time within the code itself and the piezo will set off.



**How it Works**

- The left push button sets the hour of the digital clock.
- The right push button sets the minutes of the digital clock.
- The LCD displays the output of the clock in hrs:mins:secs
- The piezo alerts you when the alarm goes off.
